# Add profiles to the community pages

In this activity you will allow users to save profile information about themselves and the provide a simple search that allows a user name to be searched for and the profile to be displayed as a result.

The details for a profile are:

- username
- profile picture
- country
- bio

To achieve this you will need to create:

- a profile template
- a create_profile route
- an edit_profile route
- a route for search that searches the profile for matching usernames and returns a list of usernames
- a display_profile route and template that displays a person's profile
- modify the navbar so that when a person is logged in they have the option to create/edit their profile
